Title

Modern Authentication

Description
-----------

Terms like OAuth, OpenIDConnect, claims, tokens, two and three legged authentication, etc. are becoming increasingly common in discussions about software development. Most of us rely on these for authentication to services we use nearly every day! In an era where applications are highly distributed and dependent on other services to perform their function, modern identity approaches are important in allowing us to access protected resources without needing to share passwords around. This talk will help unravel some of these terms, explain modern approaches to authentication and show you how to easily get started setting some of these up yourself.

This presentation was first delivered to the [2016 Yow West conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t01CXmMRQCM&t=2038s&list=PLIpl4GKFQR6cT9WOLOwvVkMm7UP89-sUX&index=18) on May 3rd 2016. It was subsequently modified and delivered to the [2016 NDC Sydney conference](https://vimeo.com/200279525) on August 4th 2016.
